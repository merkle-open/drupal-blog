A week ago, Merkle Serbia hosted the first meetup of the Drupal Community after almost 3 years! Together with Publicis Sapient & Eton Digital, Merkle gathered over 60 people from more than 10 companies with different client requirements.

Next to welcome gifts & accreditations, we have organized 5 lectures with well-known community members and online guest speakers from Romania.

The participants had the opportunity to hear more about:

* Moment for retrospective of community & technology - Stevan Antanaskovic
* 30' infrastructure - Bojan Živanović
* Decoupled Drupal approach - Melinda Csog & Iulia Calaras
* Local development with DDEV - Mladen Đurić
* Accessibility & Drupal (experience & discussion) - Bojana Pavlovic & Milica Marjanović

All recordings are available on the [drupal.rs](https://drupal.rs/) website.

### Why this event was important to us, to me?
I can not think of a better way than to have this as your everyday job. To gather people, provide a networking place, organize meaningful lectures & space to exchange knowledge and experience. That was our _Why_ during these two-month event preparations.
