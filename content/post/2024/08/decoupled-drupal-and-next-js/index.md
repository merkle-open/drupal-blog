In today’s digital world, choosing the right technologies is essential for success. This is specifically important for enterprise level applications, where wrong decisions can increase cost in further maintenance and decrease gains provided by the solution.

As user engagement is a key focus for web applications, we need to ensure that chosen technologies will be beneficial for providing best user experience.

By combining Drupal with Next.js, we are taking the next step, where we split business logic from presentation layer, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and performance.

Working on applications where the presentation layer is separated from business logic will allow us to benefit by using best of both worlds and ensures the maximum level of security.

This approach allows us to surpass limitations of traditional frontend and shift to a more robust and secure presentation layer.

## **Benefits of using Next.js in combination with Drupal**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG):**
  Since Next.js can handle both SSR and SSG, this will provide us faster and more responsive content delivery. Option to serve content rendered on the server will allow us to satisfy requirements of SEO engines and ensure perfect scores and SEO ratings.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):**
  ISR is a feature of Next.js that allows pages to be refreshed incrementally, keeping content up-to date, without losing the benefits of static rendering.
- **Hybrid rendering capabilities:**  
  When creating dynamic web applications, it’s important to split server-side from client-side logic, this not only allow us to gain speed, performances and security, but also helps with creating more robust and scalable applications. With Next.js we have the option to choose between SSR, CSR or SSG approach at any part of application.
- **Scalable and reliable to meet demands for high traffic:**  
  Next.js architecture, combined with Drupal maturity and CMS capabilities ensures that even the most content heavy applications can handle significant traffic loads.
- **Comprehensive SEO control in Drupal:**  
  Drupal is well-known for its high-level modularity, metadata control and flexible URL structures, which in combination with Next.js can provide a robust mechanism for amplifying SEO results.
- **Lazy loading and image optimization:**  
  Ensuring media files are loaded only when needed improves both desktop and mobile responsiveness.
- **Secure decoupled setup:**  
  Separating business logic and sensitive data from presentation layer ensures better security.
- **Adaptability to evolving tech:**  
  Both solutions are supported by their large communities, this ensures frequent updates, high-level security and new features to follow trends and digital innovations.
- **Scalability for growing businesses:**  
  Providing decoupled solutions using Next.js in combination with Drupal, will allow us for future adaptability while keeping the option to scale and implement different services in both areas.

## Conclusion

The integration of Drupal and Next.js offers a powerful solution that will withstand test of time and provide business high performance, scalable and maintainable applications.

By choosing Drupal as a mature and rock-solid CMS, we will benefit from its robust content management capabilities, high level security and amazing SEO optimization. With Next.js on top and its dynamic frontend experience, we ensure that application is up to date with the latest standards.

With all benefits mentioned above, we can be confident that provided solution will allow us for seamless adaptations to future challenges.
