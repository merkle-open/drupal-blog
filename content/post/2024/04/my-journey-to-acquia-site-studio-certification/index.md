As I set out to take and pass the [Acquia Site Studio](https://www.acquia.com/drupal/site-studio) certification, I really had mixed feelings about it as it’s like a Drupal module but is something totally new at the same time.
While I knew my way around a Drupal site, Site Studio was a whole new world to me. Since I’m eager to learn something new and grow, I started to dive into it right away!


Studying Acquia Site Studio was like piecing together a puzzle. It has a lot of interrelated features to aid site editors to build a site without having to write code.


[Acquia Academy](https://www.acquia.com/support/acquia-training-certification) was the main resource that I relied on. It is Acquia’s home for training and certification, designed to help you obtain, assess, and maintain your Drupal and Acquia product knowledge.
They have this 2 hour course called, Site Studio Site Building. The course is for site builders and developers who want to learn the inner-workings of Site Studio through demonstration.


Acquia also provides a sandbox environment to partners. This environment was my playground - a safe space to experiment and learn.
It is a fully built site using Drupal and Site Studio. This completely helped ease the learning curve because I was able to follow along with the demonstration course and got a sense and feel of how everything works together in Site Studio.
A lot of tinkering with the Color Palette, Font, Icon Library Responsive Grid, Base Style, Custom Style and Templates features to name a few really brought me closer to mastering Site Studio's secrets.


Other preparations were also needed before taking the exam, inside Acquia Academy, you will need to access the Acquia Certified Site Studio Site Builder course.
It provides a simple walkthrough of the Acquia Certification Exam experience with ProctorU and the steps you need to do from creating a ProctorU account, scheduling and launching the exam.
The course is where you can also find a download link for your certificate once you have passed.


On the exam day, I had experience a little delay due to technical issues but the ProctorU technical support team were very helpful.
Once everything was verified, I was given to go-ahead to start the exam. I tackled each question with a lot of tension and fear but also telling myself that I can do it and that I prepared for it.
Thankfully, I passed the exam with only 1 minute left on the clock.


In the end, passing the [Acquia Certified Site Studio Site Builder](https://docs.acquia.com/acquia-academy/study-guides/acquia-site-studio-6.x-site-builder) exam was not just about getting a certificate. It was about growing personally, staying updated on Acquia’s tools, and being ready to assist my Merkle team and our business partners, both now and in the future.
